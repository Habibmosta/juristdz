## Next Action Required

Due to file size constraints, I need to add these 6 forms in batches.
Each form requires approximately 150-200 lines of code.

The forms should be added in `components/forms/DynamicLegalForm.tsx` 
before line 1665 (the default case).

Would you like me to:
A) Add all 6 forms in one large operation (may take multiple steps)
B) Add them in batches of 2-3 forms at a time
C) Provide you with the complete code to add manually

Please confirm how you'd like to proceed.
